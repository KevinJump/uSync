 Welcome to uSync 8 for Umbraco 8

 Thanks for Installing uSync 8, All the bits of your 
 umbraco settings will now be saved to disk - if you want 
 to also sync content and media install uSync.ContentEdition.

 Targets
 -------
 The uSync NuGet package includes build targets that mean the 
 uSync folder is included when you package up your Umbraco
 site so you don't need to include it in your solution view.

 Actions
 -------
 uSync 8 manages actions (delete, renames, etc ) by creating an 
 'emtpy' action config in the place where the config file for 
 an item was. 

 This means deletes exist in place within thye uSync folder which
 makes it easier to deploy the uSync folder and not have orphaned
 items from previous versions hanging about.

 uSync is open source and free Feedback and Join in:
