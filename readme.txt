             Welcome to uSync 8 for Umbraco 8

 *** out-of-support release ***

 This release is an end of support version release, that means
 it has been compiled and released beyond the end of support date
 for uSync 8.
 
 for later versions of Umbraco you should use the version of uSync
 that matches the Umbraco version (e.g uSync v13 for Umbraco v13)

 For Umbraco 8 0 We recommend that most people use the last stable
 ""supported" release of uSync v8.11.8.
 
 This releases contains some changes that while they will almost
 certainly not cause issues for most, will not be supported
 should they do that. 

 *** out-of-support release ***

 ***
 This version works with the latest version of Umbraco 8, has
 not been tested with any other versions of Umbraco 8.
